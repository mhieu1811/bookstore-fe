  description:
    'The Catcher in the Rye is an American novel by J. D. Salinger that was partially published in serial form 1945â€“46 before being novelized in 1951. Originally intended for adults it is often read by adolescents for its themes of angst and alienation, and as a critique of superficiality in society. The novel also deals with complex issues of innocence, identity, belonging, loss, connection, sex, and depression. The main character, Holden Caulfield, has become an icon for teenage rebellion. Caulfield, nearly of age, gives his opinion on a wide variety of topics as he narrates his recent life events.',
